# guidnbatterPY (Graphical User Interface DNd comBAT TrackER in PYthon)

This is a graphical version of clidnbatter made in python.

## Features
Yet to be determined.
This is in _very_ early stages and I have mostly pulled off it to finish clidnbatter first.
This one is basically just a searchable db of the 5e SRD monsters at the moment.
